Project Overview
The main focus of this project is to analyze the diverse symptoms and complications experienced by both COVID-19 positive and negative patients. Coronaviruses, a group of viruses causing respiratory illnesses, exhibit a range of impacts, from mild symptoms like cold, fever, and dry cough to severe issues such as breathing difficulties, fatigue, chest pain, and other chronic problems. This research aims to delve into the various chronic complications encountered by COVID-19 patients.

Methodology
Using data sourced from a reputable repository, Kaggle, and adhering to standard symptoms outlined by the WHO and the Ministry of Health, Government of India, we applied advanced data analytical techniques to cleanse the dataset. Ensemble machine learning models were employed, allowing users to input predefined standard symptoms and predict the presence or absence of COVID-19.

Integration with Web Application
The developed machine learning model is not merely a standalone entity; therefore, we integrated it with a user-friendly interface. Leveraging the Streamlit framework, we transformed our machine learning model into a fully-fledged, dual-faceted web application. Users can either manually input data into each cell or directly upload patient data in CSV file format.

This project brings together comprehensive analysis, machine learning, and web application development to contribute to our understanding of COVID-19 symptoms and complications.
